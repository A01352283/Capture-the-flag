## Introduction

This repository contains two games implemented using the Pygame library: "Soccer" and "Capture the Flag." These games are designed to be used as environments for training and testing reinforcement learning agents. By providing a variety of game scenarios, we aim to facilitate the development and evaluation of RL algorithms.

## Games

### Soccer

- Description of the Soccer game.
- Screenshot or GIF of the game.

### Capture the Flag

- Description of the Capture the Flag game.
- Screenshot or GIF of the game.

You can easily add or modify games according to your requirements.
